/**
 * Grows the viewport until the whole screen fits inside it, then screenshots.
 *
 * `fullPage: true` is a no-op in this app and used to give a silently
 * truncated baseline. components/Screen.tsx renders through a
 * react-native-web `ScrollView`, which does not scroll the document — it
 * scrolls an inner `overflow: auto` div. `document.scrollHeight` therefore
 * always equals the viewport height, so `fullPage` had nothing extra to
 * capture and every baseline came out exactly viewport-sized. The
 * notifications-mobile baseline stopped part-way through the "Mute" card and
 * did not contain the Save button at all — on the very screen this suite was
 * built for, at the width where the original truncation defect happened.
 *
 * Screenshotting a locator instead does NOT fix it. That was tried and
 * measured: `locator.screenshot()` on the ScrollView returns the border box
 * (375x812, same truncation), and on its inner content container it returns
 * the full 375x907 — but the bottom 95px come back blank white, because the
 * ancestor's `overflow: auto` clips them in the compositor and capturing
 * beyond the viewport does not undo that. A baseline that is the right size
 * and blank where the content should be is worse than an obviously short one.
 *
 * So the viewport itself is grown to the content height. Nothing about the
 * render changes: these screens lay out top-down from the content column, so
 * a taller window reveals the rest without moving anything above it. Width —
 * which is what every layout defect in this app's history turned on — is left
 * exactly at the device value. Screens that already fit (sign-in, which
 * `Screen` renders as a plain View and vertically centres) are not resized at
 * all, so their baselines stay at true device dimensions.
 *
 * A baseline's height is therefore content-dependent. That is intentional:
 * if a screen grows or shrinks, Playwright reports a size mismatch, which is
 * a diff, which is the point.
